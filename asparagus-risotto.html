        <h1>Asparagus Risotto</h1>
        <p class="intro"><i>Just discovered this-super delish!</i></p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 lb asparagus, peeled, trimmed and cut into one inch long pieces, tips reserved</li>
            <li>4-6 c chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>2 T extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 T butter</li>
            <li>1/3 med red onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 c Arborio rice</li>
            <li>1/2 c dry white wine</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 c grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Bring pot of water to a boil. Add half the asparagus stalks and cook until quite soft, at least 5 minutes. Rinse quickly under cold water. Put cooked asparagus in a blender or food processor and add just enough water to allow machine to puree until smooth; set aside.</li>
            <li>Put stock in a medium saucepan over low heat. Put oil and 1 T butter in a large, deep nonstick skillet over medium heat.  When it is hot, add onion, stirring occasionally until it softens, 3 to 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is glossy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add white wine, stir, and let liquid bubble away. Add a large pinch of salt, add warmed stock, 1/2 c or so at a time, stirring occasionally. Each time stock has just about evaporated, add more.</li>
            <li>After about 15 minutes, add remaining asparagus pieces and tips, continuing to add stock when necessary. In 5 minutes begin tasting rice. You want it to be tender but with a bit of crunch; it could take as long as 30 minutes
                 total to reach this stage. When it does, stir in 1/2 c asparagus puree. Remove skillet from heat, add remaining butter and stir briskly. Add parmesan and stir briskly, then taste and adjust seasoning. Risotto should be slightly soupy. Serve immediately.
            </li>

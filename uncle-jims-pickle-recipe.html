    <h1>Uncle Jim’s Pickle Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pickling cucumbers (roughly a pound per quart jar depending on size)</li>
        <li>3 Quarts Filtered water (Filtered makes a difference)</li>
        <li>1 Quart distilled white vinegar (5% acidity)</li>
        <li>1 Cup Pickling salt (up to 25% less is acceptable)</li>
        <li>Dill and garlic to taste - Peppercorns, mustard seed, peppers, pickling spice, and other optional stuff</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put water, vinegar, and salt in a large, non-reactive pot and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Clean and sterilize jars and boil lids for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill jars with appropriate amounts of dill, garlic, and other optional stuff and pack with cucumbers. Wide mouth quart jars are easiest.</li>
        <li>Pour boiling mixture into jars, cap and seal.</li>
        <li>Put filled jars in a boiling water canner, covered with water for 8 minutes (5 minutes for Dilly Beans). Cool and check seals.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        On 8/20-21/2011, we picked 90 lbs. of cucumbers and about 8 lbs. of beans. The cucumbers were smaller than in recent years but made the best-looking pickles ever. Variations include using malt or cider vinegar. Cider vinegar is also fine, but less preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe has evolved over 10-12 years. Changes in timing and ingredients like the type of vinegar and beans have been noted to affect the outcome significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2013, we tried Dilly beans with an ice bath and no blanch. The recipe used was 2 ½ quarts water to 1 ½ quarts vinegar.

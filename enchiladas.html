    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol id="instructions">
        <!-- Add instructions here -->
        <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 400F with racks in the middle and upper third of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Lightly grease a 9 x 13-inch baking dish..</li>
        <li>Step 2: <b>To Roast the Veggies:</b> On the prepared baking sheet, combine the sweet potato and poblanos. Drizzle the olive oil over them and toss until all sides are lightly and evenly coated, adding more oil if necessary. Lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper to arrange the ingredients ina  single layer. Bake on the middle rack until the sweet potato and poblanos are tender and caramelized ont eh edges, 40 to 45 mintues, tossing halfway. Leave the oven on for the enchiladas.</li>
        <li>Step 3: <b>To make the enchilada sauce:</b> This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients (the flour, chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and cinnamon) in a small bowl and place it near hte stove. Place the tomato paste and broth near the stove as well.</li>
        <li>Step 4: In a medium saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat until it's so hot that a sprinkle of hte flour and spice mixture sizzles on contact (this will take a few minutes so be patient). Pour int he flour and spice mixture. While stirring constantly witha  whisk, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into hte mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Increase the heat to medium-high and bringt he mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you stir, 5 to 7 minutes. (The sauce will further thicken as it cools.)</li>
        <li>Step 6: Remove from the heat, then whisk in the vinegar. Season to taste with a generous amount of black pepper and extra salt, if necessary. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Step 7: <b>To Prepare the Enchiladas</b> In a medium bowl, combine the black beans, sour cream, and roasted vegetables. Season the filling with the black pepper and salt to taste. </li>
        <li>Step 8: Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce into the prepared baking dish and tilt it from side to side until the bottom fo the pan is evenly coated. To assemble your first enchilada, spread 1/2 cup vegetable filling mixture down the middle of a tortilla, then snugly wrap the left side over and then the right ot make a wrap. Place it seam side down against the edge of your pan, repeat with the remaining tortillas.</li>
        <li>Step 9: Drizzle the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas, leaving the tips of the enchiladas bare. Sprinkle th cheese evenly over the enchiladas, followed by the pepitas.</li>
        <li>Step 10: Bake, uncovered ont he middle rack for 20 minutes. If the cheese on top isn't golden enough for your liking, carefully transfer the enchiladas to the upper rack of the oven and bake for an additional 3-6 minutes, until sufficiently golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Step 11: Remove fromt he oven and let the enchiladas cool for 10 minutes (they're super hot!). Before serving arrange thin slices of avocado down the center of the enchiladas and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Serve with sour cream on the side, if you'd like. Leftovers store well, chilled; for up to 4 days. Gently reheat ina  microwave or oven before serving.</li>

            <li>Pour warm water into lage mixing bowl and stir in sugar, salt, oil, half the flour, and yeast. 
                Beat vigorously 2-3 minutes.
                Add remaining flour and stir until all dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed.
                Leave the spoon in the heavy batter and allow it to rest 10 minutes.
                Stir down.
                allow dough to rest 10 minutes and stir downa gain.
                Repeat this process until dough has been stirred down 5 times.
                Turn dough onto floured surface, knead only enough to coat dough with flour (2 or 3 times) so it can be handled.
                Divide in half and roll each part into a 9x12 in rectangle and arrange loaves on baking sheets that have been sprinkled with cornmeal.
                Cover lightly and let rise at room temperature until nearly double in bulk, about 30 minutes.
                with a very sharp knife, cut three gashes at an angle on top of each loaf; brush with slightly beaten egg, and if desired, sprinkle with sesame or poppy seed.
                Bake immediately 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees or until nicely browned.
                Remove from baking sheets and cool on racks.
            </li>
            <li>For focaccia: After following above directions, spread half the dough into a 1 x 15 inch rimmed pan. Warm about 1/4 c olive oil with 3 or 4 large minced cloves of garlic until garlic is soft and yellow.
                Make dimples with your finger or a spoon int he dough about an inch apart.
                Drizzle with garlic mixture and sprinkle with about 1/4 c parmesan. Bake in a 400 degree oven until golden brown, about 15-18 minutes. Cut into 16 pieces and serve warm or at room temperature.
